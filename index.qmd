## About Me

I’m a Technical Writer – Senior Specialist at Southern California Edison and a Master of Science in Digital Marketing candidate at Cal Poly Pomona, graduating in Summer 2025. With a background in English Literature and over a decade of writing experience, I specialize in transforming complex information into clear, engaging, and actionable insights—whether through regulatory documentation, marketing analytics, or data-driven storytelling.

I’ve written and managed over 900 pages of technical documentation, collaborated across regulatory, legal, and program teams, and contributed to high-stakes reporting initiatives. My academic work extends that clarity into digital strategy, using tools like R and Quarto to uncover insights and build reproducible workflows.

## What I Do

-   **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Creating interactive and informative visualizations using R.

-   **Digital Marketing Strategies:** Leveraging web analytics, SEO, and targeted campaigns to boost online presence.

-   **Technical Writing:** Developing clear, accurate, and compliant documentation, including operational procedures and user guides.

-   **Content Creation:** Crafting engaging and informative marketing copy for web, email, and social media channels.
